Requirements
------------
This role uses official Zabbix packages and repository for component installation. Target machines require direct or [**HTTP proxy**](#playbook-9) internet access to Zabbix repository [**repo.zabbix.com**](https://repo.zabbix.com).

For self-hosted repository mirrors, override URL for [`repository_url`](#role-variables) variable.

Tasks require `superuser` privileges (sudo).

Ansible core >= 2.13

Zabbix agent role relies on [**Jinja2**](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/) heavily and requires version >= 3.1.2

You can install required Python libraries on the control node as follows:

```bash
python3 -m pip install "Jinja2>=3.1.2"
```

Or using `requirements.txt` file in the role folder:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
